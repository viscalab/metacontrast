# Effect size

## Gathering information:

Participants: 1) Schizophrenia n = 40 -\> n = 20 Chronic tobacco users -\> n = 20 no tobacco userss

2)  Control n = 40

Contrast sensitivity (p6, figure 1) 1) Significant difference between controls and schizophrenia (both subgroups taken together) -\> p \< 0.001

Need to calculate the results from the figure (figure 1)

## Calculate effect size:

(see bookdown.org)

## Side note 1

Need to calculate the results from the figure (figure 1) Not sure how to do this. I'll take a look at it again.
